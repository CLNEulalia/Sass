#### Authors: Matt Huntington & Karolin Rafalski

## Intro
Sass is a CSS pre-processor, meaning it allows you to use some features that don't exist in CSS just yet and compiles it all into usable CSS. For example you can use: nesting, mixins, functions and more! 

> [More info at the Sass Website](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)

#### So how does SASS work? 

Sass is its own stylesheet language based off of CSS. To use the language, you must create files with a suffix of `.scss`, in which we can use all those nifty features like listed above. Browsers, however, can't understand `.scss` files. Thus in order for the scss you write to be used, the files have to be _translated_ (or, in other words, compiled) into plain CSS in a file with a normal extension of `.css` so that the browser can read them. We will learn how to translate Sass to CSS in this lesson.

*Note:* Sass can be written with two different syntaxes! The original syntax is known as Sass, and looks quite different from css syntax (it has no curly braces or no semi-colons). The other syntax is SCSS and it is very similar to the CSS syntax. Today's lesson will use SCSS syntax as it's much more familiar to us and thus easier to jump into it. 

## Getting Started

### Install Sass

Sass used to only be installable via Ruby, but the times have changed drastically since it was created and the Ruby version is actually no longer supported. This is fine because it's [much easier to install now](https://sass-lang.com/install), across any system even without Ruby. For our purposes, we'll install what's called Dart Sass globally via homebrew. 

**In terminal** (you can run this from any location)

- To install: `brew install sass/sass/sass` 
- Quit terminal and reopen it
- To check that it installed: `sass --version`

 1.32.8
 </details>
 <br/>
 
> Note: If you're on windows, you can install it via Chocolatey with `choco install sass`

### Set up Sass with the Morning Exercise Project

#### IMPORTANT! File organization matters! Make sure you are working in the correct location

## Sass & Grid Calculator

### Build

1. Find any calculator you would like to mock up or you may make one from scratch. (Feel free to use the index.html file as a template)
1. You must use Sass to style your calculator.

### Bonus

1. Give your calculator some functionality!

#### Setup In terminal 

 - Fork and git clone this repo and `cd` into `sass`, make sure you're on the same level as the `index.html` file.
 - `mkdir css` to create a css directory. 
 - `touch css/main.scss` to create a `.scss` file inside the `css` folder
 - Open a new terminal tab at this level and type:
 - `sass --watch css/main.scss css/main.css`
 	- `sass --watch` will watch for changes and update - much like `nodemon` for node!
	- `css/main.scss` the first argument is the file we want it to watch 
	- `css/main.css` the second argument is the file we want it to compile the scss into css 
	- Just a fun rumor - the creator of Sass chose `sass --watch` as the command name because of its similarity to the word `Sasquatch`

<details><summary> Expected output after sass --watch</summary><p>

```
Compiled css/main.scss to css/main.css.
Sass is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to stop.
```
</p></details>

#### Set up our workspace and check our files 

 - Go back to your other tab in terminal (don't cancel the `sass --watch`, we always want that to be running when we write sass) and `code .` the entire `sass` folder
 - You should now see some new files/folders
  - Folder: ` .sass-cache`
  - Inside the `css` folder there should now be
    - `main.css`
    - `main.css.map`
    - `main.scss` 
- `open index.html` to view the html file in the browser.

> *Thought Question* - which file should the `index.html` link to: `main.scss` or `main.css`. Why?

## Write some Sass 

### First, let's investigate how it works 

Let's start small so we can see how Sass compiles .scss into .css. If we look at our index, we can see that all the buttons are in a line to the left of the screen

##### In VSCode, in the `main.scss` file:

```
.container {
  border: 1px solid gold;
}
```
- `âŒ˜S` to save the file

##### In VSCode, open `main.css`. It should look like this:

```
.container {
  border: 1px solid gold;
}

/*# sourceMappingURL=main.css.map */

```

Refresh the index in the browser, the calculator container should have a gold border!

*Note:*  Everything in the `main.css` file should be compiled from `main.scss`, meaning **do not write directly into `main.css`.** Whenever you make a change and save it in your `.scss` file, sass will compile the _whole_ file into the `.css` file. So, any code you directly write into `main.css` would then be **overwritten** after the compilation. You wouldn't want that! So, again, when using sass, do **not** write directly into your regular css files! 

##### Close `main.css` right now so you don't accidentally work in this file.

### Errors!

Have you ever wished for errors in css? Look no further, Sass will give you errors for some things! 

Check out this one that I got, for example

![Sass error](https://i.imgur.com/0xF5cvL.png)

- Go ahead and mistype something in `main.scss` save it and reload your browser
- Fix it, save it, reload it!

> Note: Not every misspelling will throw an error, unfortunately, but it's still better than none at all! 

### Variables

CSS has since introduced variables as you've learned so far, but in case you hate writing the `var(--` opening every time, Sass has its own, slightly shorter variable functionality as well.

Let's set some color variables. 

**In VSCode, in `main.scss`, starting on line 1 add:**

```
$color-grey   : gainsboro;
$color-black  : #515358;
$color-white  : #FCFCFC;
$color-yellow : #FFCF73;
$color-red    : #F1534E;
```

Now let's apply our $sg-red color to the background of all the buttons and change the text color to $sg-white

```
button {
  background-color : $color-red;
  color            : $color-white;
}

```

Save the file and reload the browser. Ta-da! Regular CSS variables still work just fine, but these will save you a little bit of typing. 

### Functions

Yes, it's true! SCSS has funcitons. You can use some built in ones or write your own! We could probably spend days learning about all the awesome stuff about Sass. But for today we will just use the `ligthen()` and `darken()` functions, which allow us to lighten and darken colors on the fly!

Let's set up the container div first. We'll make it a flex container and let's just quickly change the color so we can see our div.

```
.container {
  border: 1px solid gold;
  background-color : darken($color-grey, 30%);
}

```

### Nesting

Additionally, we're going to want our calculator buttons to have the same width. Do we want 50%? 45%? 30%? Oh gosh! We just don't know yet! Let's set it to a variable we can change.

Put it at the top, with our other variables

```
$button-width: 20%;
```

Our beef log and cheese log divs are inside the `.featured` div - there are a few ways we access this in regular css. Some more verbose than others. Some more readable than others.

But with Sass we can nest it! Writing it this way can be more readable and maintainable.

First, let's add a border to see what our elements look like (feel free to change the border color to whatever works for. you, we'll just be using it for testing):

```
* {
  border : 1px solid gold;
}
```

Now let's target our buttons inside .container by placing the button styling inside .container's {}

```
.container {
    border: 1px solid gold;
    background-color : darken($color-grey, 20%);

    button {
        background-color: $color-red;
        width: $button-width;
    }  
}

```

Neato! We did a lot of CSS and kept it organized and DRY!


## You Do (breakout rooms)
#### Finish styling your calculator :) 


## Hungry for More

### A few more cool Sass features: 
### Explore Extend/Inherit

We can write some nice DRY css code by using extend/inheritance.

Let's write the shared properties

```
.screen:hover {
  background-color: lighten($color-yellow, 5%)
}

```

*Note:* Your page should **NOT** have changed with this CSS, yet.


Let's give these properties to the beef-log div

```
.button:hover {
  @extend .screen;
}

```

- refresh your browser and you should see the button on hover has changed


Nice work!

### Explore Import/Partials

Modularizing your CSS has many benefits. It helps organize code and it can allow teammates to work in different files.

CSS has an @import feature. But each @import is another get request to the server. You can use Sass to compile all your partials into one file first.

#### Add Your Own Partial

*In terminal, in the `css` directory:*
- `touch _fonts.scss`

*In vscode, open the `_fonts.scss` file*
- Let's bring in the calculator font

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'calc';
  src: url('../calculator.ttf') format('truetype');
}

```
*In `main.scss`: put the following with the other `@import`*
- `@import "fonts";`

*Note*: Partial files start with an `_` but when you `@import` them, do not include the `_`

Fantastic! Now let's add our new fonts!

- update the button font

```
button {
  font-family: "Speck";
}
```


### Explore Mixins

##### Mixins - another super powerful feature of Sass

Mixins are similar to @expand. However, they can take arguments.

The short version of good practices of when to use @expand and when to use @mixin: @expand should be used for related elements (similar divs in a container). @mixns should be used for unrelated elements, for example, a header and a button or if you would like to pass an argument(s).

### Write Your Own Sass Function
You can create your own functions!

From the Sass Docs:
```
@function my-calculation-function($some-number, $another-number){
  @return $some-number + $another-number
}
```
